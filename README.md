## Why
I'm annoyed at the lack of desktop app for voice, like hangouts had.

## What does it do
It just lets you keep voice open without a chrome browser. It will also check the dom for notifications and display a badge in the task bar.

## Support
Currently supports both OSX and Windows 10

## Install
Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Jerrkawz/google-voice-desktop-app/releases) and download either the windows or mac release.
** Note: The mac version is unsigned, so you will have to click "Open Anyway" after running, or go to Settings > Security & Privacy > General > Open Anyway **

Simply uzip and drag into the applications folder (mac) or run the executable (windows)

## Run From Source
`git clone git@github.com:Jerrkawz/google-voice-desktop-app.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

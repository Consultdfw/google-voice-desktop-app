Go back to design phase for theming.

Am i over complicating? Should i just provide a color palette and do the rest of the injecting under the covers with simplier selectors and !importants
Should i use scss?
Should i have more of a component structure

5 page regions that need styling, and sub regions within those pages
I probably need to vastly reduce the custom style tags
Could i create a base stylesheet with all the shit, and themes that just wanted to override the pallette could do that? Does this require inheritance? Can i runtime compile scss? AAHHH

// This will use the css selectors from the base stylesheet, and all you have to do is modify the color palette
@import 'base';
